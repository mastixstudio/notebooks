## Overview of Notebooks

### Fundamentals
- **[Constants, Calculations and Derivatives](./constants_calculations_derivatives.ipynb):**  Explore the core of MASTIX Studio. Learn to label and group constants, define calculations, and retrieve derivatives.
 
- **[Functions](#use-cases):** ***Coming soon!*** Discover MASTIX Studio's built-in functions and learn to create custom ones. This notebook features some basic analysis of the Black-Scholes option pricing formula, including solving for parameter values using a numerical solver.

<!--
### Applications
- **[Basics of change attribution analysis](./constants_calculations_derivatives.ipynb):** Explanining the changes in a simple calculation using the attribution tools.

- **[Loan book workflow](./analysis_of_loan_book.ipynb)**: An example workflow for a loan book: valuation and risk calculations.


-->
### Use Cases
- **[Pandas Analysis of Loan Book](./pandas_analysis_loan_book.ipynb)**: One possible setup with MASTIX Studio is running scheduled batch calculations and analyzing the results using analytics libraries. Among data scientists, the Pandas Python library is particularly popular. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to initiate a cash flow analysis using Pandas. We populate Pandas DataFrames with pre-calculated valuations and risks, and then perform some aggregations and visualizations.
